Title of the Project: Sharp Objects and Firearms Detection Using Image Classification to Prevent
Crimes

Executive Summary:
According to Indonesian Central Bureau of Statistics, there are approximately 1000 cases of
homicide, about 200 cases of robbery using firearms and another 800 using sharp objects each
year from 2017 to 2019. This calls for a preventive measure that can stop the perpetrator as
quickly as possible. Weâ€™re going to build an app that can detect held weapons such as knifes or
firearms using image classification. The result then will give a signal as an early SOS to be sent
to the authority, which will be beneficial for anyone in need to report the crime using firearms/sharp
objects.
